# Security Policy
At BanyuMili, we take security seriously. We welcome and appreciate any responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities that could potentially affect our framework, packages, or dependencies.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a vulnerability in BanyuMili, please report it to us by sending an email to our security team at banyumili@geniuscodeparty.com. We encourage you to use this email address instead of opening an issue on GitHub, as it will allow us to investigate the issue and respond more quickly.

## Version Support
We maintain the current and previous major versions of the BanyuMili framework. We encourage users to keep their applications up to date with the latest version of the framework to ensure they are receiving the latest security fixes and improvements.

If you are running an older version of the BanyuMili framework and are unable to upgrade, please contact us to discuss potential options for mitigating any known security vulnerabilities.
